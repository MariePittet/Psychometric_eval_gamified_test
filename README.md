This R script was developped for a multicentric study evaluating the validity of gamified neuropsychological tests in comparison to standard tests.
Analyses are available without patients' data because of their sensitive nature. 
Full reference to study will be shared when published.

Population: Individuals with subclinical cognitive impairments.
            Data were acquired across three centers, with potentially different populations. This specificity is adressed in statistical models.

Psychometrics: Convergent validity (correlational and agreement methods), and discriminant validity (i.e. the ability of the test to discriminate patients from norms). 

Additionnal analysis: linear mixed model of the effect of age on test scores according to test modality (tablet vs standard administration).
                      To answer the question: Do older people struggle more with tablets?
